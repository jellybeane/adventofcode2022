Advent Of Code 2022  
Trying out Rust this year  

Day | Theme | Notes
----|-------|-------
1   |Calorie Counting| Iterators: `sum`, `rev`, `take`  
2   |Rock Paper Scissors| match statements, Ordering
3   |Rucksacks| HashSet intersection, chunks
4   |Overlapping intervals| Overlap checks, `split_once`, `filter`, `count`
5   |Stacks| using `Vec` as stacks
6   |Tuning Trouble| `windows`, `enumerate`, `find`, generic function with trait bounds, HashSet
7   |Directory| Vec-based pseudotree, enums with data, `std::mem::swap`
8   |Grid sight lines| 2D grid, for loops over reverse ranges
9   |Rope Bridge| State manipulation, match
10  |Cathode Ray Tube| Even more state manipulation and match, `if let Some(x) = y`
11  |Monkeys| `impl` methods for a struct, fighting the borrow checker, remainders, how to keep a closure as a struct's member
12  |Elevation map| Dijkstra, Generics with Trait Bounds (`where` expression)
